# Expense Management System (PHP MVC)

A lightweight, secure, and clean **Expense Management System** built using **Native PHP** following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern.

---

## Features
* **Full CRUD Operations:** Add, view, edit, and delete expenses.
* **Smart Filtering:** Filter expenses by search keyword, category, and date range.
* **Secure Architecture:** Built with prepared statements (PDO) to prevent SQL Injection and input validation to stop XSS, future-date entries, and URL tampering.
* **Responsive UI:** Clean dashboard styled with **Bootstrap 5** and **FontAwesome** icons.
* **User Authentication:** Protected routes with session management to isolate users' data.

Step-by-Step Local Setup with XAMPP
Follow these simple steps to install XAMPP and run this project on your machine.

1. Download & Install XAMPP
Download the installer for your OS (Windows or Mac) from the official website: apachefriends.org.

Run the installer, click Next through all the steps, and finish the installation using the default path (usually C:\xampp on Windows).

2. Start XAMPP Control Panel
Open the XAMPP Control Panel from your Start menu.

Click the Start button next to Apache.

Click the Start button next to MySQL.
(The background labels for both will turn green, indicating they are running successfully).

3. Download and Move Your Project to htdocs
Download your project folder (if it downloaded as a .zip file, right-click and extract/unzip it first).

Go to this folder on your computer: C:\xampp\htdocs\

Move or copy your extracted project folder (Expense-Management-System) directly into that htdocs folder.

4. Import the Database
Open your web browser and go to: http://localhost/phpmyadmin

Click on SQL in the top navigation bar.

Paste the contents of your database.sql file and click Go (or Execute).
(This automatically creates the expense_db database, sets up the tables, and inserts sample data).

How to Run on Any Port
If your default port (80) is blocked by other software, or you just want to run it on a custom port (like 8000 or 8080), you have two simple options:

Option A: Using PHP's Built-In Server (Easiest)
You don't even need to configure Apache settings. Just use your terminal:

Open your terminal or Command Prompt.

Navigate to your project folder:

Bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\Expense-Management-System
Run the PHP server on any port you want (e.g., port 9000):

Bash
php -S localhost:9000 -t public
Open your browser and go to: http://localhost:9000

Option B: Changing Apache's Port in XAMPP
If you want Apache to serve your website on a custom port (e.g., 8080):

Open the XAMPP Control Panel.

Click the Config button next to Apache, and select Apache (httpd.conf).

Search (Ctrl + F) for the word Listen.

Change Listen 80 to Listen 8080 (or your preferred port number).

Search for ServerName localhost:80 and change it to ServerName localhost:8080.

Save and close the file, then Restart Apache in the Control Panel.

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:8080/Expense-Management-System/public/index.php

Security Measures Implemented
Future Date Prevention: Expenses cannot be logged with a date ahead of today.

Strict URL Validation: Filter values, categories, and date structures passed via URLs are fully sanitized to prevent tampering.

Isolated Data Access: Users can only view, edit, or delete expenses belonging strictly to their own accounts.
